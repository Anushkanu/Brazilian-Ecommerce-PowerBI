# Brazilian-Ecommerce-PowerBI

I'm thrilled to share my latest Power BI project: an in-depth analysis of the Brazilian e-commerce market! Utilizing real-world data from Olist, Brazil’s largest online marketplace, this dashboard uncovers crucial insights into performance, customer behavior, and logistics.

The core goal was to transform raw data into a clear narrative on sales trends, preferred payment methods, regional revenue drivers, and delivery efficiency.

🛠️ Tools & Skills:
Power BI | Power Query | DAX | Data Modeling | Data Visualization

1. Robust Data Architecture: Built a solid data model using Power Query and DAX to effectively connect and manage data across orders, customers, sellers, and products.
2. Root Cause Analysis: Utilized the Decomposition Tree visual to quickly break down Total Revenue across dimensions like Product Category, State, Payment Type, and Seller ID.
3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Created clear, high-impact metrics using Card visuals to track performance at a glance:
   - Total Orders: 98.67K.
   - Average Review Score: 4.09.
   - On-Time Delivery Rate: 91.62%.
4. Interactive Dashboards: Designed two engaging and scannable dashboards with dynamic visualizations (charts, maps, etc.) and intuitive slicers for user-driven filtering.
5. Enhanced UX with Custom Tooltips: Designed dedicated report pages to serve as Custom Tooltips, providing users with detailed, contextual data pop-ups when hovering over visualizations.
